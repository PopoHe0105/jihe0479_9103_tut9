# Week 9 quiz 
## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
### The source of inspiration I chose is the works of illustrator moon. Her pictures often feature a main tone of pinkish purple, complemented by soft halos and dreamlike compositions. In this picture, the star vending machine and the floating light spots form a wonderful sense of space. This "fantastical and gentle" visual effect is very much in line with the atmosphere of the interactive story I want to create. Therefore, I hope to draw on her style of color gradation and luminous elements in the project. ^^

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
### To achieve the floating stars and soft light effects in the illustration, I selected two p5.js examples as technical references.
1. Snowflakes
